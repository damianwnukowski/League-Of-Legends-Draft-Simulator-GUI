**OVERVIEW**

App is simulator for League of Legends champion select phase. This can be useful for creating draft without placeholders
for minor tournaments. (It is heavily inspired by official solution made by Riot Games). This particular project is
a GUI for the whole app. It was made mainly for educational purposes.

**IMPORTANT**

I didn't use maven so in order to compile it's needed to manually download used librarier (apache httpclient and 
json org). The reason for this is because it was very hard for me to solve bug where javafx package was not detected
when I was trying to use maven. Some code is not very nice but my main goal was to finish this app.
